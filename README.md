My solution for a recent programing assignment. The task was to make a simple Match-3 game in Unity.

The game mechanics are as follows:

- The game consists of m x n tiles (configurable in editor or code).</br>
- If three or more of the same tile type are in a horizontal row, the game removes them.</br>
- A tile falls down if there is no tile below it (unless it's on the bottom row).</br>
- The user can click on a tile. The game then removes the tile.</br>
- When the game starts, all the positions should be filled with tiles and nothing should fall down.</br>
- Follow the style guide (not included in this repository)
